# Attested Isolated Runtime

> **Status:** Draft. Contributed to the design-patterns workstream for working group review.
> A design pattern for the "Privacy-preserving execution" topic area.

**Also known as:** TEE-isolated agent runtime, confidential agent execution, attested enclave gateway

## About this draft

This is the first pattern submitted under the design-patterns workstream topic area
"Privacy-preserving execution (ZK proofs, TEEs, encrypted vector DBs)". It covers the
trusted-execution and hardware-attestation portion of that topic. Zero-knowledge proofs and
encrypted vector databases deserve their own patterns and are left open.

The draft is deliberately opinionated in three places, flagged inline as **Open question**,
because those are the points where the workstream should push back before this becomes final.

Contributions are welcome from anyone implementing the attestation stacks referenced at the
end of this document. The pattern is written against five independent hardware attestation
stacks and requires none of them, and review from people who operate those stacks in
production would improve it considerably. See the working group charter for how to
participate.

## Context

An agent processes data whose exposure is constrained by regulation, contract, or
classification. It runs on infrastructure the data owner does not operate: a public cloud
region, a partner tenant, a managed inference endpoint, or a customer environment where the
agent vendor is the party being audited.

Four roles matter here, and they belong to different organizations.

| Role | Interest |
|------|----------|
| Data owner | Inputs are not exposed during processing |
| Agent operator | Runs the workload and wants it to be adoptable |
| Infrastructure operator | Controls the host, the hypervisor, and the orchestrator |
| Relying party | A tool, a peer agent, an auditor, or a regulator making a decision about the agent without the ability to inspect it |

This pattern applies when the infrastructure operator sits inside the threat model. Where the
host is trusted, the containment and authorization patterns elsewhere in this catalog cover
the ground at lower cost.

## Problem

Software-only controls place the enforcement mechanism in the same trust domain as the thing
being constrained. When a policy engine, an audit logger, and the agent they govern all run
under one operating system at one operator's privilege level, four properties the relying
party depends on become unverifiable.

**The policy that executed is unprovable.** A bundle hash gets checked by a process running on
the host the operator controls, so the check carries the same privilege as the artifact it
checks. A swapped bundle is undetectable from inside that domain.

**A decision can be altered in memory.** A deserialization bug or a compromised transitive
dependency in the evaluator executes in the same address space as the evaluation. The verdict
changes and the log records the changed verdict as legitimate.

**The audit trail shares a fate with the workload.** Any party holding the signing key can
construct a consistent history after the fact. A relying party has no way to distinguish a
recorded history from a reconstructed one, which makes the trail worth exactly as much as its
custodian's word.

**Data in use is readable.** Encryption at rest and in transit leave a plaintext window during
execution. Prompts, retrieved documents, tool responses, and model weights sit in
host-accessible memory, reachable by a privileged operator, a co-tenant isolation escape, or a
crash dump.

These are structural properties of the deployment. Diligence and additional controls inside
that domain leave them in place, because the enforcement, the evidence, and the adversary all
occupy one privilege level, and the set of parties able to subvert them stays the same.

## Forces

- Relying parties need to verify claims about an agent without an audit relationship with its
  operator, and no in-band mechanism gives them that today.
- Confidential computing hardware is unavailable in many regions, instance families, and
  on-premises estates.
- Attestation costs latency at session setup and carries ongoing operational burden.
- Enclave memory is finite, which bounds what can live inside the boundary.
- Every component moved inside the boundary expands both what the isolation protects and the
  attack surface the isolation exists to defend.

## Solution

Move the enforcement point and its evidence production into a hardware-isolated execution
environment that the host operator can neither read nor modify, then require the relying party
to verify that environment before releasing anything of value.

Four elements make up the pattern. Deployments that implement three of the four are common and
give up most of the benefit, so the elements are listed with the failure that follows from
skipping each one.

### 1. Isolate the enforcement point and leave the agent outside

Run the policy decision point, the classification and redaction logic, and the evidence signer
inside a Trusted Execution Environment. AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, or ARM CCA serve CPU
workloads. GPU confidential computing applies where model weights need protection in device
memory.

The agent stays outside. Agent code executes attacker-influenced input as its normal mode of
operation, which makes it the component most likely to be subverted, and enclosing it grows
the trusted computing base by precisely that component. What belongs inside the boundary is the
small, auditable, slow-changing code whose integrity the relying party depends on. The agent,
its inference path where weights need no protection, and the tool implementations all stay
outside.

Draw the boundary so that a fully compromised agent still cannot alter policy, forge evidence,
or read data the policy denied it.

Name where sensitive input is decrypted and which components may hold it in plaintext. Inside
the boundary that is the decision point and the classification and redaction logic. Anything
released to the agent, including an allowed raw tool response or a sensitive prompt, sits in
agent memory the host can read, so the redaction step decides what leaves the boundary.
Response redaction applies to calls and responses that traverse the protected gateway.
Under tool-side enforcement, a direct tool response to the agent is outside this redaction
path and retains the confidentiality limit stated above.
Confidential processing elsewhere, such as inference on a confidential GPU, carries its own
protection and trust assumptions and is stated separately.

Acceptance condition: an authorized request whose raw response reaches agent memory is reported
as outside the confidentiality claim.

> **Open question.** This placement is the pattern's strongest claim. A workstream member who
> believes the agent belongs inside the boundary should say so, because the rest of the pattern
> follows from this line.

### 2. Generate the signing key inside the boundary and bind evidence to it

The key that signs evidence gets generated inside the isolated environment and never leaves it.
Its public part goes into the attestation evidence, so the evidence binds the key to the
measured environment.

That binding authenticates the association. It does not show where the key was generated. A
verifier accepts in-boundary origin only when the appraised code is the code that generates the
key pair, keeps the private key in protected memory, has no export path, and refuses to present
an externally supplied key as its own. Proof of possession shows the presenter holds the private
key. It does not show the key was never outside.

Skipping this element is the most common implementation error, and it quietly removes most of
the value. Attestation evidence with no binding to the key signing the requests describes a
machine and can be replayed by any party holding a copy. RFC 8747 defines the
proof-of-possession confirmation claim for this purpose (section 3). It leaves the protocol
for demonstrating possession unspecified (section 3.5) and notes that possession proof helps
only when it is fresh and replay-resistant (section 4), so a deployment names the protocol it
uses. An RFC 9711 attestation token can carry this registered CWT claim.

Acceptance condition: substitute a host-generated key whose holder can prove possession. It must
fail acceptance as an in-boundary key.

### 3. Seal policy to the measurement and release data on appraisal

Bind the policy bundle digest into the attested measurement so that a relying party checking
the measurement simultaneously learns which rules were in force. Then order the operations so
that the relying party, or a key release service acting for the data owner, verifies the
appraisal before releasing credentials, decryption keys, or scopes.

The release service encrypts credentials and decryption keys to a recipient key bound into the
attestation evidence. That key must meet the in-boundary origin and custody requirements in
element 2; a separate encryption-capable key follows the same requirements as the signing key.
The verifier issues the appraisal, and the relying party or its release service makes the
release decision and sends the encrypted secrets to the isolated environment.

Acceptance condition: a release addressed to a key the appraised environment did not generate
must fail, even when the appraisal passes.

Gating release on the appraisal is what makes attestation a control. Evidence emitted after the
work completes supports recordkeeping and leaves the outcome of the work unchanged.

A reported digest is only as good as its link to the bytes the evaluator loads. The measured
loader verifies the effective policy bytes against the digest before evaluation, and each
authorization carries that digest through to the operation it permits. Two ways hold the link:
an immutable bundle inside the measured image, or authenticated dynamic loading with an explicit
update rule under which a change to the effective policy invalidates authorizations and
appraisals issued under the old one. Prompt and tool-schema digests (see Implementation notes)
have the same limit when the component that consumes them runs outside the boundary: the digest
records what was approved, and says nothing about what that component used. RFC 9711 section
9.1 makes claim trust depend on the implementation and on verifier processing for the same
reason.

Acceptance condition: replace the effective bundle P with Q while the environment still reports
the digest of P. Every authorization issued under P and presented after the swap, and every
authorization issued after the swap, must fail.

### 4. Emit verifiable evidence per unit of work and have a separate party appraise it

Each session or action produces a signed record covering what executed inside the boundary,
under which policy digest and enforcement mode, against what data class, and which tool calls
were authorized. A verifier
independent of the operator appraises that evidence against reference values and revocation
state, then issues a signed result the relying party consumes. When records are anchored in an
append-only transparency log, a verified inclusion receipt establishes that a particular record
is included at the authenticated checkpoint. It does not establish that every relevant action
was recorded. A completeness claim also needs a declared collection scope and a way to account
for expected records that are missing.

Keep four stages distinct in the record: requested, authorized, dispatched, and confirmed by the
tool. Each claim names the component that observed it. With tools outside the boundary, the
decision point observes the request and the authorization and nothing after. A claim that a tool
executed, or returned a given result, needs evidence bound to the request from an observer
trusted for that claim, such as the enforcement point or a signed tool response. A report the
agent supplies stays marked as agent-supplied.

Acceptance condition: drop an authorized call before dispatch. The record holds an authorization
and no tool-execution claim.

Separating the verifier from the relying party has a practical payoff: tools avoid implementing
platform-specific quote parsing, and vendor verification logic lives in one place.

## Structure

```
  Untrusted host                      Isolated environment (attested)
  +------------------------+          +----------------------------------+
  | Agent runtime          |          | Policy decision point            |
  |  model inference       |          |  sealed policy bundle digest     |
  |  planner, memory       |-- call ->| Classification and redaction     |

             | call + scoped auth
             v
  +------------------------+
  | Enforcement point      |
  |  rejects unscoped call |
  | Tools, data sources    |
  | (relying parties)      |
  +------------------------+

  Appraisal and release flow:

  Isolated environment
      | measurement + bound keys + signed evidence
      v
  Independent verifier (reference values, revocation)
      | signed appraisal
      v
  Relying party / key release service
      | on acceptance: secrets encrypted to the attested recipient key
      v
  Isolated environment

  Signed records --> Transparency log (optional)
```

The agent sits on the untrusted side of the boundary. That placement is the pattern. Its only
route to a tool runs through an enforcement point that checks the scoped authorization.

## Implementation notes

**Put the boundary at the interception point.** MCP deployments have a natural seam at the
tool-call boundary: intercept, evaluate, redact, and sign inside the boundary, and leave the
client and the tool implementations outside it. Agent-to-agent paths have their seam at the
delegation issuance point.

**Enforce where the agent cannot route around it.** A verdict returned to the agent is advice.
A compromised agent can skip an optional interceptor, call the tool directly, or change the
resource or arguments after evaluation while its runtime appraisal stays valid. Each protected
operation passes an enforcement point the agent cannot bypass: a gateway inside the boundary
that makes the call, or a tool that accepts only an authorization bound to the evaluated
operation, resource, and intended recipient. Credentials released on appraisal carry the same
scope. Freshness applies to the action authorization and to the appraisal behind it, since a
freshly signed authorization can carry an expired appraisal (RFC 9334 section 10).
Bind each action authorization to an issuer-scoped, single-use action identifier. Before
dispatch, the enforcement point atomically records that identifier as spent. Consumption state
survives restart and is shared by every instance that can accept the authorization; an
unavailable or uncertain consumption check prevents dispatch. A failed or uncertain dispatch
keeps the identifier spent, while the evidence records the outcome separately.

Acceptance condition: under the stated policy, a direct tool call without authorization, a call
whose arguments differ from those evaluated, and a call carrying an expired appraisal are each
rejected. Replaying an authorization after its first use, concurrently at another enforcement
instance, or after restart must not dispatch a second action. An uncertain first dispatch
must not make the authorization reusable.

**Extend the measurement chain past the platform.** Firmware, kernel, and image measurements
tell a verifier which container executed. They say nothing about the system prompt, the tool
schema set, or the policy bundle, and those artifacts determine agent behavior. Include the
digests of agent-defining artifacts in the measured set so the evidence answers a question a
relying party actually asked.

> **Open question.** Which artifacts belong in the measured set. System prompt, policy bundle,
> tool schemas, and model weights digest are tractable. Retrieved context and memory state are
> dynamic and possibly unbounded, and the workstream should decide whether they are in scope
> for this pattern or belong with secure memory lifecycle management.

**Define a re-attestation interval.** Evidence produced at session start describes the process
at session start. Agent sessions run long. Either re-attest on an interval or bind evidence per
action, and record the choice in policy so operators can reason about it.

**Fail closed and price the cost.** An unreachable verifier, stale revocation data, or an
unrecognized measurement should deny. This makes agent availability depend on verifier
availability, which is a real tradeoff that deserves a deliberate decision ahead of the first
incident.

**Plan for measurement churn from the start.** Firmware updates, kernel patches, base image
bumps, and policy changes all change measurements. Reference value distribution needs an owner,
and in most organizations today it has none.

**Specify a software-only mode.** A signed-but-unattested mode producing structurally identical
evidence lets teams develop, test, and run conformance suites with no confidential computing
hardware, and lets relying-party policy distinguish the two assurance levels explicitly.
Adoption stalls at hardware procurement without it.

Acceptance condition: hold the action identifier, policy identifier, and other authorization
inputs fixed. Under a relying-party policy that requires hardware attestation, a
signed-but-unattested record must not authorize release. A hardware-backed record must authorize
release when its evidence passes appraisal and all remaining policy conditions are satisfied.
Record the enforcement mode and appraisal result separately; matching record structure must not
erase the assurance distinction.

## Trade-offs

### What the pattern gains

- The host operator moves from trusted to untrusted, which is what makes cross-organization
  claims about an agent checkable.
- Policy enforcement and its evidence stop sharing a fate with the workload they govern.
- Data in use gains protection on the protected path: the decision point, classification and
  redaction, and the signer. Plaintext released to the agent stays readable by the host.
- A relying party decides on evidence and needs no audit relationship with the operator.

### What the pattern costs

- Attestation and key release add latency at session setup, and per-action attestation adds it
  per action.
- Hardware availability bounds where the pattern can be deployed at all.
- Enclave memory limits bound what fits inside, which bites hardest where weights need
  protection.
- Operational burden is ongoing and routinely underestimated: reference value management,
  revocation freshness, TCB version floors, and firmware upgrade coordination.
- Verifier availability becomes a dependency in the request path. Caching appraisals trades
  freshness for availability.
- Trust moves to a different set of parties. Silicon vendors, reference value publishers,
  transparency log operators, and verifiers all become trusted. The pattern improves on
  trusting a host operator and still requires trust.

### What the pattern does not do

- It leaves misbehavior possible. An agent under prompt injection or goal drift produces
  entirely valid evidence of having done the wrong thing. The pattern makes what executed
  checkable and says nothing about whether it was correct.
- It offers no defense against TEE side channels, covering cache, timing, speculative
  execution, and power analysis.
- It covers no action that stays inside a deployed binary. Logic that never crosses an
  instrumented boundary is bound by measurement and build provenance alone.
- It addresses neither availability nor denial of service.
- It leaves the human in the loop exposed to interface-layer manipulation.

## Anti-patterns

**Attestation theater.** Attestation reports get produced and nothing consumes them. No
verifier sits in the path, no relying-party policy keys off the appraisal, and no data release
depends on it. The report answers an audit question and changes no outcome. Test for this by
asking what breaks when attestation returns a failure. An answer of "nothing" identifies
recordkeeping.

**Unbound evidence.** Attestation reports get published while requests are signed with a key
that lives in the host filesystem. The evidence describes a machine, replays freely, and proves
nothing about the requester.

**Attest once, trust forever.** Verification happens at connection establishment and the result
is treated as valid for the session lifetime. Agent sessions run long and a measurement
describes a moment.

**Enclosing the agent.** The whole agent, its planner, its memory, and its tool clients go
inside the boundary on the theory that more inside means more secure. The trusted computing
base now contains the component that ingests attacker-controlled input, and a prompt-injected
agent inside the enclave reaches everything the enclave protects.

**Self-appraisal.** The operator runs the verifier, appraises its own evidence, and presents the
result as third-party verified. This has the security properties of a self-signed audit log.

**Fail-open verification.** An unreachable verifier, an unparseable quote, or stale revocation
data is treated as a pass to keep production moving. The control goes absent under exactly the
conditions that indicate compromise, and nothing surfaces its absence.

**Hardware as the whole answer.** A TEE gets deployed and the agent is declared governed.
Absent sealed policy, bound keys, and gated release, a TEE is an isolated environment running
ungoverned code.

Imran Siddique, Opaque Systems.

Opaque Systems sells confidential computing infrastructure and the contributor authored several
of the implementations listed above, which makes this pattern commercially favorable to the
contributor's employer. Three properties of the draft exist to constrain that bias: it is
written against five independent attestation stacks and requires none of them, it specifies a
software-only mode as a legitimate deployment so members without confidential computing
hardware stay in scope, and it enumerates costs and limits at the same length as benefits. The trade-offs and anti-patterns sections are where review pressure will
do the most good.
